### Hit Die
`d4`

### Skills
`Per Level`: 2 + Int

`Skill List`: Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Disguise (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int)

### Class Features

`Weapon and Armor Proficiency`: A perceptionist is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield.

`Spellcasting`: A perceptionist casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dead necromancer's spell list. Like a sorcerer, they can cast any spell they know without preparing it ahead of time. When a perceptionist gains access to a new level of spells, they automatically knows all spells for that level given on the perceptionist's spell list. Perceptionists also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below).

To cast a spell, a perceptionist must have a Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a perceptionist's spell is 10 + the spell's level + their Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a perceptionist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Their base daily spell allotment is given bellow. In addition, they receive bonus spells for a high Intelligence score (see Table 1â€”1 on page 8 of the Player's Handbook).

All spells cast by a perceptionist are considered mind-affecting.

`False Reality (Su)`: Any creature who is charmed, under compulsion, or affected by a phantasm by the perceptionist can have their consious reality subtly altered. 
The DC for resisting these effect is 10 + Class Level / 2 + Int bonus.

#### Anmesia
At first level the perceptionist gains the ability to make a creature so affected forget its time charmed. When the perceptionist sucessfully charms, compels, or phantasms a creature, they can choose to apply this effect. If they do, once the charm lifts, the creature must make a will save or forget their time under the charm. The missing time could instead be percived as a blackout, a drunken haze, a psychedelic trip, etc.

`Advanced Learning (Ex)`: At 4th level, a perceptionist can add a new spell to their list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a bard, cleric, or wizard spell of the Mind Affecting type, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the perceptionist already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that perceptionist's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell they know. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a perceptionist. A perceptionist gains an additional new spell at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

`Enchanting Aura (Su)`: *In Progress*

## Spells
The following is the spell list for perceptionists. One must note that all perceptionist spells rely on the manipulation of target's perception (hence why all perceptionist spells are given the mind-affecting discriptor if they don't already have it). Thus, rather than invisibility (for instance) manipulating light to bend around a hidden creature, it is clouding the minds of any viewers of that creature. A similar concept applies to other illusion-y spells. Any spell which is partially real (for instance, an illusion that can be touched) not only manipulates the subjective, but has some effect on the objective, begging the question, what does it mean to be real?

## Notes

Maybe the power word spells should be added to the spell list?

At higher levels False Reality effects might include creating illusions (major image, halluciatory terrain, ect.) that only the charmed creature can see, rewriting events that happened during the charm, or (at high levels) applying lingering effects of the charm.

Other abilities might involve caster-level bonuses to illusions and enchantments. The ability to affect undead/constructs (in a limitted way) with mind-affecting effects. An enchanting aura that charms creatures (similar to a fear aura).
