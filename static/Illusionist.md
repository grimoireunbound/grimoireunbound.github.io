### Class Features

`Weapon and Armor Proficiency`: A _____ is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a _____'s movements, which can cause their spells with somatic components to fail.

`Spellcasting`: A _____ casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dead necromancer's spell list. Like a sorcerer, they can cast any spell they know without preparing it ahead of time. When a _____ gains access to a new level of spells, they automatically knows all spells for that level given on the _____'s spell list. _____ also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below).

To cast a spell, a _____ must have a Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a _____'s spell is 10 + the spell's level + their Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a ____ can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Their base daily spell allotment is given bellow. In addition, they receives bonus spells for a high Intelligence score (see Table 1â€”1 on page 8 of the Player's Handbook).

`Advanced Learning (Ex)`: At 4th level, a _____ can add a new spell to their list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a cleric or wizard spell of the illusion or enchantment schools, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the _____ already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that _____'s spell list and can be cast just like any other spell they know. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a ______. A _____ gains an additional new spell at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.
