# Basic Set

The [Basic Set](BasicSet.pdf) includes GURPS 4e Basic Set: Characters and GURPS 4e Basic Set: Campaigns, and should be all that is needed to create a new character as a PC, and for the GM to devise templates and encounters for those characters. 

# Magic

The [Magic](Magic.pdf) suplement expounds on the rules for magic found in the Basic Set and provides hundreds of pre-built spells and colleges.
